<h1>Managing Resque with Upstart</h1>



<p>This is a long overdue update to my previous post <a href="/articles/2012/03/12/manage-and-monitor-resque-with-upstart-and-monit">Managing Resque with Upstart and Monit</a>. Much has changed in the world of process management and system administration and it&rsquo;s time to update my previous post with what I see is the current Best Practice.</p>

<p>First, Monit is gone. I haven&rsquo;t installed or used this tool in a long time. That isn&rsquo;t to say Monit is a bad tool, I&rsquo;ve just come to see it is a redundant layer. Over the years I don&rsquo;t remember ever receiving an alert that was worth acting on; it has all been noise. Along those lines, I&rsquo;ve never had problems keeping Resque alive, and if it&rsquo;s my code that causes Resque workers to die, exception handlers and other application monitors have always told me so very quickly.</p>

<p>Besides the alerting capabilities, the main reason I recommended Monit in the previous post was as a way to to manage multiple Resque processes with a single command. I needed to be able to start/stop/restart all Resque processes without knowing how many a server was running and Monit groups worked very well for that. Now, however, I&rsquo;ve seen better ways of using Upstart to manage multiple processes, so Monit is no longer required in this setup.</p>

<p>This new way actually comes from the new kid in the background-jobs scene: <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>. Sidekiq is API compatible with Resque, can be run in multiple processes like Resque, but is meant to be run in a threaded mode. Threaded mode leads to more efficient use of resources especially when under JRuby or Rubinius (due to the lack of a GIL). The Sidekiq project includes a multitude of management scripts, covering SysV, Runit, and of course Upstart. You can find all of the scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/tree/master/examples">examples directory</a> of the project. For our case, check out the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/tree/master/examples/upstart">upstart</a> directory, where there are two sets of scripts, one set for managing <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/examples/upstart/workers.conf">multiple apps and workers</a> and a set for managing a <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/examples/upstart/sidekiq.conf">single app</a>. The key to these scripts is Upstart scripts calling other Upstart scripts, something that didn&rsquo;t occur to me back then. Adapting to Resque shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult, and if I do such a thing I&rsquo;ll be sure to update this post with the scripts I used.</p>

<p>So in summary, use Resque or Sidekiq and Upstart. Nothing else required.</p>
